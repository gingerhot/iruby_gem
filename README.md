# IrubyGem

`iruby_gem` is a pack of lines of code used to install gems in a Ruby program on the fly, especially in a [IRuby](https://github.com/SciRuby/iruby) notebook, or IRB/Pry console.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'iruby_gem'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install iruby_gem

## Usage

```ruby
require 'iruby_gem'

gem_install("some_gem", "~> 0.2.1")
# Or shortly for a lazy guy
gem_i("some_gem", "~> 0.2.1")
# and you can omit the version restriction if you don't need it
gem_i("some_gem")
```
